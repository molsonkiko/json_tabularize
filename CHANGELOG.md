## [Unreleased] - yyyy-mm-dd
 
### To Be Added

- Support for multiple tables in the same JSON object.
- Convenience functions for export to other formats like CSV and HTML. Best practice right now is to read the output into a DataFrame with pandas and then export it to some other format from the DataFrame.
- Change the script so that it can output the JSON in other formats.
 
### To Be Changed

- Remove the dependency on GenSON and add my own schema parsing function. GenSON is excellent and I currently see no reason to do this.
 
### To Be Fixed

json_tabularize version 1.0.0 is now available on the Python package index.
It has been tested for Python 3.6 to 3.10.

### Added

- Everything!
